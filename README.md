# CovidVaccineTrackerC 
Project to track vaccination records of the staff and students of a university. The basic version of the tracker does the following:

- Loads records from a file and populates them into array of structs

- Prints a main menu allowing the user to add, view, modify and sort records in addition to viewing stats such as percentage of people vaccinated

- Writes updated vaccine data to a file in a structured manner
    
The extended version of the tracker has the above functionality as well as allowing for storage of multiple vaccination vendors and dates to reflect the two vaccine doses and boosters.
